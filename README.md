# 2023-react-starter-boilerplate

A repository to help anyone get started on their projects for React.

Setting up a repository can take plenty of manhours, research, and unncessary amount of headaches trying to get everything working together. 

This repository is basically a preset of various frontend stack/technology/tool/whatever installed and preconfigured to work out of the box and with VS code (ew).

Will be updating this repository as I continue learning the tech more. So this is not representative of //bleeding=edge// technologies working out of the box.

**Frontend Stack**
 - React
 - Vite
 - ESlint
 - Typescript
 - TailwindCSS
 - [SWC](https://swc.rs/) (?) - Just came with vite, so I installed it, could be useful

**WARNING**: I'm not sure if the setup is optimal or contains any issues. Getting everything to work in the first place already chipped part of my sanity.

(minor rant) Learning and starting web development is filled with crazy overhead nowadays. e.g: I need to learn 3-10 basic concepts just to display a graph, or even just a simple `hello world` on HTML. You'd think it would've been easier with time.
